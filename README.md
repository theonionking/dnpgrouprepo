All of the project is contained in the .ZIP File. Since I was working in a solo group (me - Nicolae Jereghi - 254120) after my teammate left, unfortunatelly, the assignment project is very raw and multiple things are present but not everything works. It has a huge part of the requirements and services coded but most of them need more work in order to actually do their job correctly/work. Folders were organized so it's a lot easier to find what you need.

!!! BEFORE 'dotnet run' TRY 'add-migration Initial' AND 'update-database'
